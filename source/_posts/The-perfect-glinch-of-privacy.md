In the last month I talked with my friends Charles and Felipe Santos about privacy information, follows:  
  
Nice Charles! [TOR](https://tails.boum.org/) and [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) is the best we have. In 2011, i watched this [presentation](http://www.flickr.com/photos/35149312@N05/sets/72157627908851107/) in [H2HC](http://www.h2hc.com.br/).  
  
I did't know riseup, but i think the problem is to big, because internet is a network inter-operable by physical infrastructure provide by governments, telecoms and hardware/software manufacturers. Google is a part of the problem and get out your power it's good, but no sufficient for guarantee your privacy. Honestly, it's very difficult.   
  
By example with riseup PKI use [http://www.gandi.net/ssl](http://www.gandi.net/ssl) and gandi use comodo and comodo is US company and you need entrust in all stakeholders, included telecoms and hardware manufactures, so, it's very difficult. We need more open hardware/software and more transparency by telecoms. I recommended you create your PKI environment and stay your servers on safe location, provided by transparency telecoms, governments, companies and etc.  
  
Resume: Internet is a network cooperable by all stakeholders and the privacy is a dream. Privacy its possible, but you need observe constraints.  
  

I don't know if you using OpenPGP, but is the first pass for email: [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto)
