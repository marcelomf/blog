Hi folks,  
  
We started the MVC NodeJS Framework called GrãoJS. We are working hard to launch the first release at October 15, 2013.  
  
**GrãoJS work with:**  

1.  Micro-kernel architecture (graojs core)
2.  IoC - Inversion of Control (graojs core)
3.  DI - Dependency Injection (graojs core, angularjs)
4.  MVC - Model View Controller(graojs)
5.  Scaffolding (graojs generator)
6.  RAD - Rapid Application Developer(graojs  builder, it's a frontend for mongoose schemas and graojs generator, maybe we'll utilize fabric.js)
7.  Authentication (nodejs passport)
8.  RBAC - Role Based Access Control (mongoose rbac, we'll work to support activity based access control)
9.  RestFUL and engine of static and controllers routes (nodejs express)
10.  RIA - Rich Interface Application(angularjs, angular-ui, twitter bootstrap 3)
11.  ODM - Object Document Mapping(nodejs mongoose, we'll work to support ORM)
12.  Template Engine (jade, but if you prefer others engines, it's very simple support it)
13.  Internationalization (nodejs i18n)

  
**GrãoJS team work on:**  

1.  FOSS - Free and Open Source Software (sure :))
2.  DIY - Do It Yourself
3.  DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
4.  KISS - Keep it Simple, Stupid
5.  GoF - Gang of Four
6.  XP - eXtreme Programming
7.  SCRUM - Agile manifest! Atelier alternatively to factories!
8.  Hakim Bey ideas (TAZ and Caos)

  
We work on collaborative enviroment and with autonomous people. We love freedom.
